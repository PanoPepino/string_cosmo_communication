String Cosmo Documentation
==========================

Welcome to the documentation of String Cosmo. This library include several animations crafted over the years for string cosmology presentations (with big focus on braneworld cosmology).
Perhaps you can find some inspiration to create your own animations related to your theoretical physics research? Do not hesitate on branching the `Github <https://github.com/PanoPepino/string_cosmo_communication>`_ repository and let us enhance together this library!!

.. note::

   This is a personal package under construction. New features and a more optimised organisation will come. In case you find some and/or have some suggestions, please
   report at `github issues <https://github.com/PanoPepino/beanim/issues>`_.

Example Presentation
--------------------

This is an (old) example of a presentation crafted with Manim + Manim-Slides + Beanim + String_Cosmo (Focus on the scientific sketches):
