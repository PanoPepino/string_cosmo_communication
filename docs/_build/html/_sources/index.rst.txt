String Cosmology Communication Documentation
==============================================

String Cosmology Communication is a Manim library for creating beautiful visualizations and animations of string theory and braneworld cosmology concepts.
Its main philosophy is to provide simple, scientifically accurate objects for communicating complex theoretical physics ideas through engaging animations.
You can find the repository on `Github <https://github.com/PanoPepino/string_cosmo_communication>`_.

.. note::

   This is a research communication package under active development. New features, more cosmological scenarios, and enhanced visualizations will be added regularly. 
   If you are interested in collaborating or have suggestions for new features, please feel free to contribute or report issues at 
   `github issues <https://github.com/PanoPepino/string_cosmo_communication/issues>`_.
