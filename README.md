# About String_cosmo
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[TO BE IMPROVED]

- This repository contains v2.0 of string_cosmo (previously known as mtheoretical) libraries. 
- This package includes animations on string and braneworld cosmology research communication.
- While the package is currently quite limited, it will continue increasing and evolving as new concepts need to be explained within the field.

Bla bla bla

[!WARNING]

[TO BE IMPROVED]

- The package will be displayed in pip as **manim_string_cosmo**. This is also the way to import the package in the preamble of your python files. However, documentation and webpage will just keep the name as **string_cosmo** for simplicity.
